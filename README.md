Genetic algorithm

1. Initialize population 
2. Calculate fitness of each individual
3. Continue if not every individual has maximum fitness
4. Basing on their fitness the probability of selection is calculated
5. 2 individuals are selected for mating
6. Cross over (85% probability)
7. Mutation (2% probability)
7. New population is created (with number of individuals preserved)
8. If all individuals have maximum fitness stop
