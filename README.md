Genetic algorithm

1. Implement population 
2. Calculate fitness of each individual
3. If all individuals do not have equal fitness CONTINUE
4. Basing on their fitness the probability of selection is calculated
5. 2 individuals are selected for mating
6. Mating
7. New population is created (with number of individuals preserved)
8. If all individual have equal fitness STOP
